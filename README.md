## Mine Financial Model
This is a simple excel financial model I built using this youtube video as reference https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qo-hCfO5sQ, it allows the analyst to play with a variety of assumptions such as ore composition, labour & operating costs, and initial startup investment. The running cash flow graph allows the user to easily visualize in which year will the mine break even.
